## 🧑‍💻 About Me
I'm **Alperen**, a passionate developer diving into the world of software and game development.  
Currently learning how to build games using **Unity** and **C#**. I enjoy turning ideas into playable experiences!

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- 🐍 **Python** – Automation, scripting, bots, APIs.
- ⚙️ **C# (Unity)** – Game development, gameplay mechanics, UI systems.
- 🌐 **JavaScript** – Web applications, user interactions, browser-based games.
- 🛢️ **SQL** – Database handling and queries.

> 🕹️ *Fun fact:* My first ever scripting experience was with **AutoHotkey (AHK)** — macros and keyboard automation stuff!  
> I don't use it much anymore, but it helped me get into programming.

## 🎮 Game Development Journey
- 🔧 Currently learning **Unity** and building small 2D/3D games.
- 🎓 Exploring topics like physics, animations, UI, and input systems.
- 🧪 Experimenting with game ideas and mechanics as I grow.
